In this repository are contained all the files that contain source code in GO language produced for me. I decided to study GO in my vacations (January 2018) because I wanted to learn parallel and concurrent programming using a specific language for this. In this repository are contained all the files that contain source code in GO language produced for me. I decided to study GO in my vacations (January 2018) because I wanted to learn parallel and concurrent programming using a specific language for this. Most of the code is implementations of the Caleb Doxsey (O'reilly) "Introduction to the GO Language" book. In addition to having implemented everything, I translated the names of variables and functions into Brazilian Portuguese. I put a lot of comments on the codes as well. I have also modified some of the examples too to make them clearer or better for learning.
