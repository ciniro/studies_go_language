# studies_go_language
This repository contains source code files in GO language produced by me. I decided to study GO during my vacation (January 2018) because I wanted to learn parallel and concurrent programming using a specific language. Most of the code is implementations of the book "Introduction to the language GO" by Caleb Doxsey (O'Reilly). In addition to having implemented everything, I translated the names of variables and functions into Brazilian Portuguese. I also put a lot of comments on the codes. I also modified some of the examples to make them clearer or better for learning.
